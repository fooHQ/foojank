# Vessel

Vessel is a cross-platform C2 agent. Its runtime contains a scripting engine which allows the operators to execute custom payloads
in the memory of the running process. The scripting language, called [Risor](https://github.com/risor-io/risor), draws inspiration
from Go and Python. The capabilities of the engine can be further extended with modules.

The agent communicates through a NATS server.
